    <h1>Lines of defense</h1>

    <h2>First Line of Defense</h2>
    <p>The first line of defence (or outside defence system) includes physical or chemical barriers that defend the skin from infections. These can include the skin, tears, mucus, saliva, cilia, stomach acid, and white blood cells called neutrophils.</p>
    <p>Pathogenic (disease-causing) microorganisms must make it past this first line of defence. If this defence is broken, the second line of defence within your body is activated.</p>
    <h3>Skin</h3>
    <p>Skin is the largest organ of our body. It acts as a barrier between invaders (pathogens) and your body. Skin forms a physical barrier to prevents most outside substances such as water unable to pass through. Therefore, microorganisms that live all over your skin can’t get through your skin unless it’s broken.</p>
    <h3>Tears, mucus and saliva</h3>
    <p>Your nose, mouth and eyes are the obvious entry points for pathogens. However, tears, mucus and saliva contain an enzyme that breaks down the cell wall of many bacteria. Those that are not killed immediately are trapped in mucus and swallowed. Special cells line and protect the nose, throat and other passages within your body. The inner lining of your gut and lungs also produces mucus to trap invading pathogens.</p>
    <h3>Cilia</h3>
    <p>Very fine hairs (cilia) lining your windpipe move mucus and trap particles to keep it from your lungs. The particles can be bacteria or material such as dust or smoke.</p>
    <h3>Stomach acid</h3>
    <p>This is the acid inside our stomache when we digest food or other substance. Stomach acid kills bacteria and parasites that have been swallowed.</p>
    <h2>Second Line of Defense</h2>
    <p>The second line of defence against pathogenic invasion is the innate immune response, which has two key qualities. First, that it is non-specific and cannot differentiate between specific microorganisms and second that it is non-adaptive meaning that it produces the same response every time - in other words, it does not possess memory</p>

    <h2>3rd Line of Defense</h2>
    <p>The final line of defense is specific resistance, which is a component of acquired immunity. It can be called adaptive, specific or acquired immunity. Specific resistance relies on antigens, or specific substances that are found in foreign microbes. Most antigens are proteins; they act as a stimulus to produce an immune response.</p>
    <p>Lymphocytes are specific white blood cells, T cells and B cells, that are responsible for acquired immunity. A specific immune response occurs when antibodies produced by B cells encounter antigens. Lymphocytes can be in our lymphatic system or our blood. Lymphocytes spend most of their time in the lymph node and muscosa associated lymphoid tissue.</p>
    <p>T cells have a T cepter and B cells have antibodies which are specific to a single antigen, which is a molecule pathogens have uniquely to each of them. Therefore, there are millions of different T and B cells specific to a single type of antigen.</p>
